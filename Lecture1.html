<h1>Lecture 1: 你好，你叫什么名字？</h1>
<p>You probably know what that first phrase is, but the rest is saying "what is your name?". If you were to respond to that, it would be "我叫Jacob."<br>
  But what is 我? What is 你? Well, those characters are identified as <strong>nouns</strong>. I'll give you a list of them right now!</p>

<em>*<strong>她</strong>们 also works, but only when the "they" includes all females, and all females only. It's not necessary to use it in that situation though~</em>
<p>Let's give you a few examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>我</strong>叫婷婷。
    (<strong>My</strong> name is 婷婷.)
  </li>
  <li><strong>他</strong>叫云云。
    (<strong>His</strong> name is 云云.)
  <li><strong>我</strong>的妈妈叫立岩。
    (<strong>My</strong> mother's name is 立岩.)
  </li>
  <li><strong>你</strong>的妈妈叫Heidi。
    (<strong>Your</strong> mother's name is Heidi.)
  </li>

<h3>Tone Marks (音标)</h3>
<p>You've already seen tone marks from the table under the <strong>Pinyin</strong> column, but what do they mean? <br> </br>
  Tone marks are used to pronunciate Chinese characters. What makes tone marks convenient is the fact that there are only 4 tones. Of course this website <br>
  can't visually show you how to pronounce these tones, so here's a video to help you out.

<section class="CNY1">
  <h3>CNY Project: Lion and Dragon Dance</h3>
  <p>This will be the start of a long project to celebrate Chinese New Year! This special holiday starts on <strong>February 1st, 2022</strong>, and ends on <strong>February 11th</strong>.<br>
     Although the dates are far away, there's still time to prepare and learn more about its festivities! Two of the most common festivities are the <strong>Dragon Dance</strong><br>
      and the <strong>Lion Dance</strong>.</p>
  <p> During the Lion Dance, two performers would be play the role as the lion; the person in the front is the head of the lion, and the person in the back is the <br>
     rear of the lion. They would mimic the lion's movements in order to bring good luck and fortune. Here's a video of a team performing at the World Lion Dance <br>
     Championship. You'll be able to see the swift movements that make the lion fully animated!</p>

  <p>
    The Dragon Dance involves multiple performers. They would have to use poles to handle the movement of the dragon as it tries to look for the <strong>pearl in the front</strong>. <br>
     The longer the dragon is in the dance, the more fortune and good luck you're provided. <em>The dance starts at 1:41.</em>
